## Reflection

This was a 2 week long project built during my Winter Holidays at FactoriaF5. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with PHP using MVC. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router` and finally `axios` for comunicating with the server repository. One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Axios and a significant JSX. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup.
